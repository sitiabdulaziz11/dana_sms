ls -R students  to list all file and folder in student directory


1. What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?

Server-Side Rendering = Django builds the HTML page on the server and sends it to the browser.

Example:

return render(request, "students/registration.html", {"form": form})


This means:

Django loads the template file.

Fills it with data (form, errors, student data…).

Sends complete HTML to the browser.

The browser does not build the page; the server does.

This is how classic Django apps work.

✅ 2. What Django automatically gives you (built-in security)

Django backend has many features already implemented, so you do NOT need to write them manually.

I’ll explain each simply.

🔹 A) Cookies
✔ Meaning

Cookies are small pieces of data stored in the user's browser.

Example cookie:

sessionid=abc123xyz


The browser sends cookies automatically with every request.

✔ How Django uses cookies

Django stores the sessionid cookie to know who the user is.

✔ How to check?

Open your browser → Developer Tools → Application → Cookies.
You'll see:

sessionid
csrftoken


These are created by Django automatically.

You did not build them — Django built them.

🔹 B) Sessions
✔ Meaning

A session is a place on the server where Django stores user-related data.

Example:

request.session["student_id"] = 44


This data is stored on the server and identified by the cookie sessionid.

✔ Why sessions are secure

Data is NOT stored in the browser.
Only a random ID is stored.
So the user cannot see or modify session data.

✔ How to check?

You are already using it:

request.session["current_step"] = 3


Django automatically saves it in your sessionid.

🔹 C) CSRF Protection
✔ Meaning

CSRF = Cross-Site Request Forgery
Django automatically prevents attackers from submitting forms without your permission.

✔ Django protection

Every POST form includes:

{% csrf_token %}


Django automatically validates this token.

✔ How to check?

Try removing {% csrf_token %} from your form →
Django will show:

CSRF verification failed


This proves Django protects you.

🔹 D) Login / Logout Decorators

Django has built-in decorators to require authentication:

from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

@login_required
def dashboard(request):
    return render(request, "dashboard.html")


If the user is not logged in → Django redirects them automatically.

✔ How to check?

Visit the page without logging in → you will be redirected.

🔹 E) Permissions

Django has user roles & permissions built-in.

Examples:

Which user can add student?

Which user can edit?

Which user can delete?

You can check permissions in the admin panel → Users → Permissions.

Example:

from django.contrib.auth.models import Permission


Or enforce permission:

from django.contrib.auth.decorators import permission_required

@permission_required("students.change_studentregistration")
def edit_student(request):
    ...

🔹 F) Secure Password Hashing
✔ Meaning

Django never stores plain text passwords.

It stores hashes like:

pbkdf2_sha256$260000$fjdkir43...$asd9sdASD92...


These cannot be reversed.

✔ How to check?

In your DB, look at:

auth_user


Password column is hashed, not readable.

✔ You don’t need to implement hashing

Django does it automatically when you create a user:

user.set_password("mypassword")

🔹 G) User Authentication System

This includes:

Login

Logout

Password hashing

Session management

Permissions

Groups

Password reset

Admin interface authentication

Django gives all this when you write:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
]

🟦 3. Why does this mean you don’t need JWT?

Because Django templates communicate directly with the server; the server handles:

✔ Login
✔ Who the user is
✔ Permissions
✔ Sessions
✔ Cookies
✔ Authorization
✔ CSRF

JWT is used only when:

You have React

You have mobile apps

You have external clients

You are building an API system

For server-rendered Django websites → Django’s built-in session auth is more secure and easier.

🟢 4. If Django already has these features, how do you “activate” them?

You already activated them.
Django auto-activates them when you include the following in settings.py:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
]


and in middleware:

MIDDLEWARE = [
    "django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware",
    "django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware",
    "django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware",
]


Nothing more is needed.

🟩 5. Summary: What built-in security Django provides
Feature	Meaning	Django Does It Automatically?
Server-side rendering	Django builds HTML	✔
Cookies	Browser stores session ID	✔
Sessions	Server stores user data	✔
CSRF Protection	Prevents form attacks	✔
Login/logout	User authentication	✔
Permissions	User access control	✔
Secure hashing	Protects passwords	✔

All of this is already working without you coding any of it.


How to check Cookies in DevTools?”

Yes — you check this after running your Django app.

Steps:

Run server:

python manage.py runserver


Open browser → go to your website (example: http://127.0.0.1:8000)

Open Developer Tools:

Right click → Inspect

Go to Application tab

Left side → Cookies → your site

You will see cookies like:

Name	Value	Purpose
sessionid	random hash	Django login session
csrftoken	random hash	CSRF protection

If you see these → Django security is already working.

✅ 4. Explanation of Django Security Features
✔ 1. Cookies

Small data stored in the browser.

Django uses cookies to save the session ID.

You don’t need to configure anything — it works automatically.

✔ 2. Sessions

Django stores the user’s data in the server, not in browser.
Example:

You log in → Django creates a session

Browser only receives sessionid

Actual data is saved in DB → more secure

Check in Django admin → django_session table.

✔ 3. CSRF Protection

Prevents attacks where someone tries to submit a form pretending to be you.

Whenever you use a POST form in Django:

{% csrf_token %}


Django automatically validates it.

If it's missing, Django gives:

403 Forbidden — CSRF verification failed


Means security is working ✔

✔ 4. Login/Logout decorators

Examples:

from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

@login_required
def dashboard(request):
    ...


This blocks the view unless the user is logged in.

Test:

Open dashboard without login → Django redirects you to login page

✔ 5. Permissions

Used for admin-level access:

@permission_required('students.add_student')
def add_student(request):
    ...


Django checks:

is this user allowed to add student?

✔ 6. Secure Hashing

Django never stores passwords as plain text.

Passwords look like:

pbkdf2_sha256$320000$FJyL...


You can check this in Django admin → Users table.

You never see real password → only hashed.

✅ Conclusion
✔ Django Templates mean Django builds HTML on server
✔ React means HTML is built in browser using JavaScript
✔ Django security (cookies, sessions, CSRF, hashing) is automatic
✔ You can verify cookies by checking DevTools after running your project
