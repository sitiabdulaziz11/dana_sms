Suggestions for what to display on dashboard

For a primary school system, useful widgets are:

✅ Total Students (male/female breakdown)

✅ Attendance summary (today’s present/absent %)

✅ Payments summary (paid vs pending)

✅ Recent student registrations

✅ Teachers count / classes count

How other computers access it

Now imagine students in the library with desks and laptops.

If their laptops are connected to the same school Wi-Fi (or LAN cable network),

They can type the server’s IP address in their browser and access the system.

So:

Server computer runs Django (python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 or deployed via Apache/Nginx).

Other computers type something like:
http://192.168.1.10:8000
and they’ll see your Django app!
