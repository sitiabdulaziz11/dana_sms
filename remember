mistake is the greate opportunity to learn
that image and writens about team on web site.

- make choies for gender
- make years scroleble
- make choies for nationality and searchable
- order alphabetically when students register

how to relate , subject, teacher, grade, section, result,(admin is it requer?)

i have this models, what should i do next?

function to add/sum, sub.... , wole views

.order_by('debited_month')

why i do all this from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Payment

class PaymentAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('payer_name', 'debited_month', 'payment_type', 'payment_status', 'amount_paid')
    list_filter = ('payment_type', 'payment_status', 'debited_month')
    search_fields = ('payer_name',)
    ordering = ('-debited_month',)
    list_editable = ('payment_status',)

admin.site.register(Payment, PaymentAdmin)?

HOW TO Export this to PDF/Excel?
